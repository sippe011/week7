<p>I am unfamiliar with the esri server (as a student of MURP my experience with this is minimal) and so my map is just visuals. I'd like to understand better how to log into, and use the Arc server for maps. Overall I love this map/ story-telling concept. I would need more time to really evaluate the additional functionality of this process.</p>
